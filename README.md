# HexadokuSolver

The following code solves a 16x16 sudoku puzzle. The HexadokuDriver takes the name of the file containing the unsolved puzzle as input and outputs the answer to the terminal.
The file used as input must contain values 0 - F, and the character '-' for blank spaces that need to be solved to produce a valid output.
To use this code to solve your own puzzle:

  1. compile HexadokuDriver.java 'javac HexadokuDriver.java'
  2. run HexadokuDriver with the filename of the incomplete puzzle as the argument 'java HexadokuDriver Hexaduko3A.txt'
  3. watch the output be printed to the terminal!
